- Understand local labels
- Ability to add areas, etc, as well as moving labels which refer to the same
  data
- Select multiple tiles from a tileset at once
- Rectangle select / fill
- Deal with ConstantsMappings that don't have a mapping for a value 
- Figure out how to deal with hard-coded warp destinations (Moblin's Keep)
- Update "data/gashaSpotRooms.s" as necessary?
- Provide an interface for editing "data/singleTileChanges.s"?
- Dungeon editing: can't add more than 4 floors?

- Interactions:
    - Handle interactions referencing same data
    - Show the values from constants/interactions.s
    - Static dungeon objects

- Tileset editing:
    - Collisions
    - Add/remove tilesets, deal with 00/0c using the same mapping/collision
      files

- Bugs:
    - Crash when changing animation index
    - Crash when area ID is too high

- Needed for feature parity with ZOLE:
    - Probably will do these through disassembly:
        - Dungeon portal editing
        - Gale seed warp editing
        - Start editing
        - Dungeon essence teleport editing
        - Enemy editing

    - Palette editing
        - Smooth palette fades
    - Treetop editing
    - Dungeon minimap editing
        - Also change properties like how many floors
    - Static dungeon objects (minecarts)

    - Provide info for asm hacks (remove beginning locks, etc)
