Before Release:

- Interactions
    - Handle interactions referencing same data
    - Show the values from constants/interactions.s
    - Static dungeon objects
- Tileset editing:
    - Collisions
    - Add/remove tilesets, deal with 00/0c using the same mapping/collision
      files
- Ability to add areas, etc, as well as moving labels which refer to the same
  data
- Dungeons:
    - Dungeon minimap editor
    - Change floors, other attributes in a dungeon
- Rectangle select / fill
- Bugs:
    - Crash when changing animation index
    - Crash when area ID is too high

    - Probably will do these through disassembly:
    - Palette editing
    - Dungeon portal editing
    - Gale seed warp editing
    - Start editing
    - Dungeon essence teleport editing
    - Enemy editing

    - Treetop editing
